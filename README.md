Hacktoberfest, in its 9th year, is a month-long celebration of open-source software run by DigitalOcean. It is a great opportunity for everyone, from seasoned developers to students and code newbies, from technical writers to UX designers, to contribute to open-source communities and develop your skills, with the perks of winning limited edition items. You can do this in a variety of ways:

* Prepare and share your project for collaboration
* Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
* Organize an event
* Mentor others
* Donate directly to open-source projects
